I built a Koolaid jar using HTML Canvas, CSS and Javascript (not Jquery).

I just really wanted to work with HTML canvas and I found a fun way to do it.

Have fun changing colors and serving guests!

Further improvements:
-- As jug fills up with koolaid,animate it to be like liquid filling a jar.
-- Animate liquid in jug, give it a flow feel
-- let liquid flow out of jug and into cups
-- Animate jug to pour liquid
